This example is based on the PyTorch [DCGAN Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html).

It highlights the generator and discriminator networks, how to build them and what loss is used to optimize the model.



## Starting

To run the code, download the dataset and execute

```
python dcgan.py
```
