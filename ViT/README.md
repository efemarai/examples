An example model of the [Vision Transformer](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy) model. It is a strategy for vision based classification with the transformer architecture.
It relies on the [vit-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch) implementation, which can be installed with
```
pip install vit-pytorch
```

More examples around Distillation, Deep ViT, CaiT, Token-to-Token ViT, Cross ViT, etc can be found in the above repository.



# Starting

To run the code, you need to have Pytorch [Vision Transformer](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch) installed. 

To start the example run


```
python vit.py
```
